# 👋 Hi, I’m Antonio
  
- 👀 Professionally, I'm interested in growing my skills and experiences within full stack development
- 💞️ This repository is intended to have sections for different projects I've worked on in the past
- 📫 If you have questions or generally want to collaborate on something, feel free to reach out via a message on GitHub or or [Send Email](mailto:AntonioAcostaTechPro@gmail.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his - would also be comfortable with a they/them/theirs if you want solidarity
- ⚡ Fun fact: Despite never learning how to swim, I once dove off a 20' cliff during a white water rafting trip down the Colorado river

# Past Work Repo

- This work will be organized in folders either associated to a class, program, or programming language as necessary. These are not necessarily intended to be fully working code as some were written on previous versions of code development or were sitting in my code folder on my computer and I ported them here to begin collating historical work. 
- Assume these are not works in progress. While I am publishing on a public repo, I do not intend to refresh or modernize these projects. I'll create separate repositories for work that I'm actively developing or can be shared as working code. 
- In short: use it if you want to, but I won't be responsible for any issues that arise. I'll gladly try to help if I'm able, but assume it's As-Is
